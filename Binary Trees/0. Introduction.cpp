Binary Tree: 
A tree structure where each node has at most two childrenâ€”left and right.

Node:
 Contains data and pointers to left and right children.

Root Node:
 The topmost node and starting point of the tree.

Children Nodes:
 Nodes directly connected to a parent; a parent can have up to two children.

Leaf Nodes: 
Nodes with no children; they appear at the ends of the tree.

Ancestors: 
All nodes along the path from a node up to the root.

Full Binary Tree:
 Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

Complete Binary Tree:
 All levels are fully filled except the last, which is filled from left to right.

Perfect Binary Tree:
 All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at the same level.

Balanced Binary Tree:
 Height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

Degenerate Tree:
 Each parent has only one child, forming a linear structure like a linked list.
