/*
Problem Statement: Given a Binary Tree, return its Top View. The Top View of a Binary Tree is the set of nodes visible when we see the tree from the top.

Algorithm / Intuition:-
To imagine the Binary Tree from above, we visualise vertical lines passing through the tree. Each vertical line represents a unique vertical position. Nodes to the right of the tree’s centre are assigned positive vertical indexes. As we move to the right, the vertical index increases. Nodes to the left of the tree’s centre are assigned negative vertical indexes. As we move to the left, the vertical index decreases.


We use a map data structure to store the nodes corresponding to each vertical level of the tree as the map automatically sorts the elements based on their ascending value. Against each vertical level, the node highest in the tree at that vertical level is added by traversing the tree level order wise (BFS).

/*
Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. This complexity arises from visiting each node exactly once during the BFS traversal.

Space Complexity: O(N/2 + N/2) where N represents the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.
