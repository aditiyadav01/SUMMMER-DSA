/*Problem :-
Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.

You can return the answer in any order.
ex:-
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
Output: [7,4,1]
Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.

âœ… Intuition:-
We can't solve this by just going down the tree from the target node â€” we also need to go up (to the parent) which requires knowing each nodeâ€™s parent. Here's the high-level strategy:

ðŸ§  Steps / Intuition

1. Mark Parent Nodes (1st BFS):

Do a level order traversal to store the parent of every node in a map.

This is necessary because binary trees don't have a built-in reference to their parent.

2. BFS from Target (2nd BFS):

From the target node, explore all neighbors (left child, right child, and parent).

Use BFS to go k levels from the target.

Use a visited map to avoid cycles.

3. Collect Result:

After reaching level k, all the nodes in the queue are at that distance.

/*
âœ… Time Complexity (TC)
1. markParents() (BFS to track parents):
Visits every node once.

âœ… O(n) where n = number of nodes in the tree.

2. distanceK() (Second BFS from target):
In the worst case, it may visit all nodes up to distance k.

But still, each node is visited once.

âœ… O(n)

ðŸ”¹ So overall:
ðŸ•’ Time Complexity = O(n)

âœ… Space Complexity (SC)
We use extra space for:

parent_track map â†’ stores parent of each node:
âœ… O(n)

visited map â†’ to avoid revisiting:
âœ… O(n)

Queue for BFS â†’ in the worst case holds ~n/2 nodes (last level of tree):
âœ… O(n)

ðŸ”¹ So overall:
ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity = O(n)
